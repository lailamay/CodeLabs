Project Information

Project Description
Make an open ended full-stack project that focuses on the prompt: "As a student, my life would be easier if I had..." This lets the students decide on what kind of application they would like to build with a specific customer in mind (other students), with the constraints/requirements that it uses Django, Heroku, and GitHub (among some other tools).

Project deliverables, customer stories, project requirements
Customer stories will be based on what type of project the group eventually decides on. However, the project will have the following requirements: 
As a user, I should be able to login using a Google API. I should be able to do something meaningful with that (i.e. store or manipulate information that is limited to that specific user).
(The rest will be defined based on the project that is chosen).

Architecture of the app
Django (Python 3)
MVC architecture
GitHub (for code management)
Heroku or AWS (EC2) (for cloud deployment)
Postgres (for backend/database management)
Travis-CI (continuous integration) 

Project roles
Note: each person in the team is responsible for doing the same amount of work, regardless of their role. Depending on what each member is comfortable with, they can choose to prioritize working on the front or back end, but they must have a thorough understanding of how the entire system works. 
Scrum Master - keeps everyone on the team on track, facilitates and holds team meetings, and monitors for progress, status, and issues. This person can be the main point of contact between the team and the mentor. 
Software Architect - helps to refine and document the overall architecture of the project and makes sure that all the parts and pieces of the project work cohesively together.
Testing Manager - responsible that the entire system is fully tested and is responsible for running beta tests at the end of the month. They will be responsible for teaching and helping the team write unit tests for features that are built out. 
Weekly breakdown
Hereâ€™s the link to the Google Calendar if you want a more graphical approach.

Week
Goals
Week 1 

(July 6 - July 10)
Have a reasonable project idea in mind (ideally by 06/08/20). 
Successfully setup communication, tools/accounts, and meeting times.
Take time to understand everything in the technology stack by going through tutorials, asking questions, and perhaps even diving headfirst into the project.
Have a list of features and a roadmap for completion (i.e. how long do you think this feature will take?) for each of the features. 

Week 2 

(July 13 - July 17)
Start pulling features off of the backlog and work on them.
Have the system working from code to deployment (should be working before each meeting).
Have unit tests set up and have at least one working.

Week 3


(July 20 - July 24)
Continue pulling features off of the backlog and work on them. At this point, you should have your core functionality done.
Have the system working from code to deployment (should be working before each meeting).
Write unit tests for your features and have them passing on Travis-CI (or whichever CI you choose).


Week 4


(July 27 - July 31)
Congrats on finishing a project from start to finish! :-)
At this point, you should be polishing your features and making sure they work well. Work on the UI and front-end and make sure it looks clean (but not overly minimal).
Beta test! Have a couple of your friends/fellow students test out your app, give feedback, and bug fix.
Prepare a demo for the end of the week that highlights the core functionality of your app.
Have the system working from code to deployment (should be working before each meeting)
